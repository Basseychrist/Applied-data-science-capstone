# SpaceX Data Collection using API

This project involves collecting historical launch data for the Falcon 9 rocket from the SpaceX API. The goal is to gather a dataset that can be used to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

## Files

-   `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data collection and wrangling.
-   `dataset_part_1.csv`: The output dataset generated by the notebook, containing cleaned and structured launch data.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb` performs the following steps:

1.  **API Request**: It sends a GET request to the SpaceX API (`https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past`) to retrieve data about past launches.
2.  **Data Parsing**: The JSON response is parsed and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
3.  **Data Filtering**: The dataset is filtered to include only **Falcon 9** launches, excluding Falcon 1.
4.  **Data Enrichment**: Since the initial API response contains IDs for certain fields (like Rocket, Payload, Launchpad, and Cores), the notebook uses helper functions to make additional API calls and retrieve human-readable names and details for these fields.
    -   `getBoosterVersion`: Fetches booster names.
    -   `getLaunchSite`: Fetches launch site names, longitudes, and latitudes.
    -   `getPayloadData`: Fetches payload mass and orbit information.
    -   `getCoreData`: Fetches landing outcomes, reuse counts, and other core details.
5.  **Data Construction**: A new DataFrame is constructed using the enriched lists of data.
6.  **Data Wrangling**:
    -   Missing values in `PayloadMass` are replaced with the mean payload mass.
    -   The data is formatted and prepared for analysis.
7.  **Export**: The final cleaned dataframe is exported to `dataset_part_1.csv`.

## How to Run the Lab

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
    -   `requests`
    -   `pandas`
    -   `numpy`
    -   `datetime`

    You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests pandas numpy
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook**: Open `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or Visual Studio Code.

3.  **Execute Cells**: Run the cells sequentially.
    -   The notebook will install necessary libraries (if uncommented).
    -   It will define helper functions.
    -   It will fetch data from the SpaceX API.
    -   It will process and clean the data.

4.  **Output**: After running all cells, you will find the `dataset_part_1.csv` file in the same directory. This file contains the processed dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
